- Hello, I’m @lovelacej18, but you can call me J!
- I’m interested in many things! I keep my hands in a lot of pies. Right now I'm exploring creative programming as well as data visualization.
- I’m currently learning bash scripting and python for data analysis!
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are going to help me stretch my skills and explore new areas. This especially goes for lower-level programming languages.
